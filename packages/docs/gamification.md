# Gamification

## Overview

Our gamification system is designed to incentivize user activity across OP Mainnet, Base, and other OP Chains. Users earn points for various on-chain actions and can exchange them for rewards. Additionally, non-transferable badges recognize significant achievements and unlock exclusive benefits.

## How It Works

- Users perform on-chain activities such as transactions, DeFi interactions, governance participation, and NFT engagement.
- These activities earn SC Points, a fungible ERC-20 token minted only by authorized contracts.
- Points can be exchanged for ETH, NFTs, testnet tokens or other prizes.
- Badges, which are non-transferable ERC-1155 NFTs, are awarded for reaching specific milestones and unlock special privileges.

## Points

SC Points are ERC-20 tokens minted upon achieving specific actions or through raffles. They are transferable, allowing users to exchange them for valuable assets. However, spent points are burned to prevent reuse. These will be issued in the chain where the achievement was unlocked, or in optimism for ecosystem-wide badges. In particular we'll have a off-chain service monitoring events and submitting mint batches to the relevant chains.

There can be multiple potential prizes, to kick it off we'll start with the following:
- Exchange for eth
- Redeemable for exclusive NFTs
- Tradeable for testnet tokens

### Issuance

## Badges

Badges are non-transferable ERC-1155 NFTs awarded for specific achievements. They serve as proof of engagement and unlock various blockchain benefits. These will be issued in the chain where the achievement was unlocked, or in optimism for ecosystem-wide badges. In particular we'll have a off-chain service monitoring events and submitting mint batches to the relevant chains.

Some example use cases can be:

- Unlocking NFTs from a collection
- Unlocking rewards from a raffle
- Unlocking testnet tokens
- Unlocking promotional prices for swaps
- Unlocking airdrop participation
- Unlocking raffle participation
- Etc

Why non-transferable:
- Badges provide exclusive benefits such as access to raffles, special NFTs, and promotional rates. Making them non-transferable prevents users from passing them around to exploit rewards. Only those who achieved these badges should be rewarded incentivizing this way the engagement of more users.

### Issuance

We will issue badges for milestones in activity, leaving room for future expansions:

Activity-Based Badges
- {25,50,100} Days active on {chain}
- {25,50,100} Days active on the Superchain
- {25,50,100} Transactions on {chain}
- {25,50,100} Transactions on the Superchain
- {25,50,100} Defi interactions on {chain}
- {25,50,100} Defi interactions on the Superchain

Future updates may introduce additional badge types based on user feedback and ecosystem developments.

## Points raffle

To further enhance user engagement, we have introduced the **Points Raffle** system. Participation is exclusive to users who hold badges, with ticket distribution based on badge ownership. Each raffle round may feature different prizes and eligibility conditions, but in general, tickets will be allocated based on users' achievements.  

For example, if a raffle focuses on activity, users with **25 days of activity** might receive **10 tickets**, while those with **50 days of activity** could get **20 tickets**, and so on. This approach rewards committed users with better odds while still keeping the system accessible to newcomers. Additionally, all participants must manually claim their raffle entry, increasing on-chain interactions and maintaining user engagement.

The prize will always be SC points that can later be exchanged in the marketplace.

## Summary

Our gamification framework fosters increased user participation across OP Chains through SC Points and Badges. SC Points function as an incentive mechanism, while non-transferable Badges offer exclusive perks. Together, they create an engaging, rewarding, and secure ecosystem that benefits users and the broader Superchain network.
